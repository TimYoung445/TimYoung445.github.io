    <h2>Summary of Lord of the Rings</h2>

    <p>
      <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic fantasy novel that
      follows the journey of a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who is
      entrusted with the monumental task of destroying a powerful and malevolent
      artifact known as the One Ring. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord
      Sauron to dominate Middle-earth, and its influence corrupts those who
      possess it. To prevent Sauron from regaining his full strength and
      plunging the world into darkness, Frodo must venture across treacherous
      lands, accompanied by a diverse fellowship including his loyal friends
      Sam, Merry, and Pippin, as well as the wizard Gandalf, the human Aragorn,
      and others.

      As Frodo and his companions navigate perilous landscapes and confront
      various foes, they encounter themes of bravery, friendship, and the
      struggle between good and evil. The quest takes them through the elven
      realms of Rivendell and Lothl√≥rien, the mines of Moria, and the war-torn
      lands of Rohan and Gondor. Ultimately, the fate of Middle-earth hinges on
      the success of their mission to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount
      Doom, where it was originally forged. The story is a rich tapestry of
      heroism, sacrifice, and the enduring power of hope in the face of
      overwhelming darkness.
